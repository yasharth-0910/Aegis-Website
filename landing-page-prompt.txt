# AEGIS Landing Page - Detailed Prompt

## Project Overview
**AEGIS** is a cutting-edge urban safety intelligence platform that transforms how citizens, businesses, and agencies approach urban safety through predictive, severity-weighted crime analytics. This is a Next.js web application with a coral theme (#ff5a5f) that should convey innovation, trust, and safety.
